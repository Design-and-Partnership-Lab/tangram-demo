It would be rewarding cuz I’m actually actively helping people and I want to do a job where I’m actually about actually actively helping people and also it’s you could say the same for a doctor but at the same time you’ve working with people at the worst in Life but in education you working at people who have the opportunity to go someplace else. I know an issue with the Ph.D program especially with the first few years. It’ll be a lot of work understanding your bearings and stuff which I know can be difficult at first but overall I see way more upsides than downsides and I feel like getting a PhD and becoming a professor is a career I really want to pursue and that I’d be really happy cuz I really love research and I really love like teaching and that combines both of them.
